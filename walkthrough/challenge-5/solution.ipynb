      "As a regular user, I want to securely log into my account using my username and password, so that I can access personalized features and maintain my privacy.'\n",
      "# assistant - BusinessAnalyst: '**Acceptance Criteria**:\n",
      "1. **User Interface Display**:\n",
      "   - The login page should display fields for entering a username and password.\n",
      "   - The login page must include a \"Submit\" button to initiate the login process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Input Validation**:\n",
      "   - The system should validate that both the username and password fields are not empty before submission.\n",
      "   - If either field is empty upon submission attempt, the system should display an error message \"Both username and password are required.\"\n",
      "   - The password field should mask input characters for security.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Authentication Process**:\n",
      "   - Upon submission, the system should verify the username and password against stored credentials.\n",
      "   - If the credentials are incorrect, the system should display an error message \"Invalid username or password. Please try again.\"\n",
      "   - After three consecutive failed login attempts, the account should be temporarily locked for a duration of 15 minutes, displaying the message \"Your account has been locked due to multiple failed login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Session Handling**:\n",
      "   - Upon successful login, a session must be initiated and maintained to keep the user logged in.\n",
      "   - The session should expire after 30 minutes of inactivity, requiring the user to log in again.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Security Measures**:\n",
      "   - All password data stored in the database must be encrypted.\n",
      "   - The login form should be protected against SQL injection and other common security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Redirection After Login**:\n",
      "   - After successful authentication, users should be redirected to their personalized dashboard page.\n",
      "   \n",
      "7. **Accessibility**:\n",
      "   - The username and password fields, as well as the \"Submit\" button, should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts and should be compatible with screen readers for visually impaired users.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Responsive Design**:\n",
      "   - The login page should be responsive and render appropriately on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Performance**:\n",
      "   - The login process should be executed within 5 seconds under normal conditions, barring any network or system-related delays. \n",

      "These criteria ensure the login functionality is secure, user-friendly, and accessible while promoting a good user experience.'\n",

      "The acceptance criteria listed largely cover necessary functionalities and security for the login process. However, the feasibility of implementing session handling in relation to user inactivity requires more details:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Session Tracking Method**: The criteria specify that the session should expire after 30 minutes of inactivity, but there is no mention of how user activity or inactivity will be detected and managed. Determining session inactivity can be complex depending on whether the client-side (web browser) or server-side tracking is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestion**:\n",
      "- Define whether the activity tracking will be implemented via client-side scripting (like JavaScript event listening for user interactions) or through server-side checks (for instance, with each server request considering the last activity timestamp). Ensure that this chosen method aligns with current architectural capabilities and privacy requirements. Adding details on the preferred session tracking method will help in evaluating the implementation feasibility and security implications, especially concerning privacy and compliance with regulations such as GDPR.'\n",
      "# assistant - UXDesigner: '**Feedback on Acceptance Criteria**:\n",
      "\n",
      "The acceptance criteria incorporate basic accessibility features for visually impaired users, but additional elements can further enhance accessibility across different impairments:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestion**:\n",
      "- Expand the accessibility criteria to include proper use of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmarks, roles, and properties to ensure the login form is fully accessible for users with assistive technologies. This will help provide better context to screen readers and other assistive devices, making the entire form more navigable and understandable for users with varying disabilities.'\n",
      "# assistant - QAAnalyst: '**Feedback on Acceptance Criteria:**\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the acceptance criteria mentioned is for the login form to be protected against SQL injection and other common security vulnerabilities. However, this is too broad and needs to be more specific to be testable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestion:**\n",
      "- Specify types of common security vulnerabilities to be addressed beyond SQL injection. Include items such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery), and others relevant to the application. Additionally, define tools or methods to be used for testing these vulnerabilities, such as using automated security scanning tools or conducting manual penetration testing. This will help in creating clear and testable criteria.'\n"
